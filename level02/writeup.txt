Step 1: Use cat on the file "level02.pcap"
            (.pcap files containes packets sent back and forth between hosts).
Step 2: Install and open Wireshark as it makes it extremely easy to see inside the .pcap file format.
Step 3: Select the option "Analyse" -> "Follow" -> "TCP stream" and a window pops up
        containing the packets assembled together.
        The content format "ASCII" is selected by default and shows a line containing what seems to be the password.
        If we use it as it is, it won't work.
Step 4: Use the option "Show data as" and select another format.
        We choose "Hex Dump" to see the hexadecimal value of each byte,
        and it looks like whomever was trying to type the password was deleting some of the characters,
        because we can see the hex value "7F" or DEL character in between the "password".
Step 5: If we delete the characters right before the DEL characters we end up with the string "ft_waNDReL0L", which is the pas        password to get into flag02.
