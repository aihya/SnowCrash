Step 1: We "cat" the file level04.pl and we find a perl script. There is a comment signifying there's a server running on port 4747.
        If we open the site nothing shows up.
Step 2: The script uses a library called CGI (Common Gateway Interface) which serves as a protocol for command execution via web requests.
        The "param" inside the curly braces contains the key-value pairs passed inside the URL.
        "x" is a subroutine (function, method... whatever) that take the first argument, execute it inside the command `echo $y 2>&1` and print the result back.
        And then the subroutine "x" is executed with whatever comes inside "param", if it happens to be the key "x", use it, otherwise... MiSsIoN AboRt.
Step 3: The owner of the script is "flag04", which means we can try to run the command "getflag" with his previliges.
        We're clever so we use the "getflag" as value for the key "x" and put in the URL like this localhost:4747?x=getflag and... Fu, nothing.
        The reason is that "getflag" is treated by "echo" as a string which returns "getflag" back. So if we used backticks like this `getflag`, it'll be evaluated
        first, then the result will printed back.
