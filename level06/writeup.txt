Analyzing the level06.php we found out there's a vulnerability in pgrep_replace evaluation modifier "/e" allowing to evaluate
a function or a variable if there is a match.
In the x function we can observe there's pattern with evaluation modifier ("/(\[x (.*)\])/e"), and when a match is found,
the y function (y(\"\\2\")) is called. And because y takes the \2 (the second group match) wrapped around quotes,
we cannot call php syscalls (system("getflag") or something like that) to be executed.
So the only thing we can try is to write it this way ${`getflag`} to make php evaluate it as variable and thus throw an error,
because the variable doesn't exist and we get the flag anyway.
