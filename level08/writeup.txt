After analyzing the disassembly code of the binary, we found out there's an if condition checking whether the file name match
the string "token", which is the name of file token in home (we suppose it contains the flag).
We cannot use token as a parameter to ~/level08 because the user level08 doesn't have permissions, so we create symlink to token
with a different name.
It'll give us the password to user flag08 and we get flag from there.
