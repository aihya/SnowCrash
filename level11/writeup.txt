We have a lua script presumably running on flag11 and its listenning in port 5151 for connections,
if has an infinite while loop requesting for a password, hashs it and compares the hash to a hard coded
string. We notices a print funtion that prints "trying " concatenated with the raw password received.
We passed the command `getflag > /tmp/flag` as a password, so when passed to print function,
"l" will be evaluated on prompt and it's irrelevant whether the if statement fails or not.
