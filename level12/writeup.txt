In this level it seems like a web server is running in the background on port 4646, we can access it using the the browser, se we assume that its running on flag12.

It does accept two aguments, y and x as parameters.

after some ananlysis it seems like y will have litte use since the only operation its used in pattern matching that cant be useful since the parameter is evaluated as a string and not a regex, so we will concentrate our efforts on the x parameter.

It's seems like there a replacement regex applied on x that will make the string upercase, then a substitution regex that will remove whatever comes after the first whitespace.

then theres a shell command evaluated then stored in the array output, it seems like that where the vulnerability lands.

so we need to execute a command or something that will get us the flag during that command evaluation.

since everything in $xx is uppercase we cant use regular commands, but by creating a script named VULMN that will run the "getflag > /tmp/flag" and naming it in uppercase we can make it execute our command by passing in argument x=`/*/vulmn` so when the egrep will call the executable and the flag will be set in /tmp/flag
