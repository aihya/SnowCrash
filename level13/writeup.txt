There's multiple ways to solve this level, but all of the ways we found are using the disassembly features in gdb.

The first way would be to just jump to the instruction that calls ft_des function that create the flag, avoid the check of getuid.
The second way would be to just print out the result of the direct call to ft_des using the same argument as in the binary.
